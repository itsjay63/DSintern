"""  Problem Statement:    (bitly.json)    In 2011, URL shortening service Bitly partnered with the US government     website USA.gov to provide a feed of anonymous data gathered from users     who shorten links ending with .gov or .mil.        In 2011, a live feed as well as hourly snapshots were available    as downloadable text files.         This service is shut down at the time of this writing (2017),    but we preserved one of the data files.        In the case of the hourly snapshots, each line in each file contains a     common form of web data known as JSON. (Use bitly.json file from Resources)    Replace the 'nan' values with 'Missing' and ' ' values with 'Unknown' keywords        Print top 10 most frequent time-zones from the Dataset         Count the number of occurrence for each time-zone        Plot a bar Graph to show the frequency of top 10 time-zones.        From field 'a' which contains browser information and separate out browser capability(i.e. the first token in the string eg. Mozilla/5.0)        Count the number of occurrence for separated browser capability field and plot bar graph for top 5 values.        Add a new Column as 'os' in the dataset, separate users by 'Windows' for the values in  browser information column i.e. 'a' that contains "Windows" and "Not Windows" for those who don't"""
