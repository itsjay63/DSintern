unsupervised ML --------------------------------------------------------	

only feature data is given ,so it is called unlabeld dataset
and here we cant find mapping function because y(label) is not given
Clustering or Association 

clustering : group data based on features is called clustering
		   : algorithms 
				k means
				dbscane (density based scan)
				Hirarical clustering

Association : 	recommendation engine 
				if user purchase item x so what would be the probability user will buy
				item y. so they put item y in suggestion list , to show that who buys 
				item x also buys item y1, y2 , y3 , etc. which are closely associated 
				with item x.
				amazon,flipkart,myntra,netflix,important in reatil(stuff together which are 
				closely associated)
			:algorithms 
				apriori
				

Data analytics-----------------------------------------

descriptive analytics (what happned)
predictive analytics (what will happned)
prescriptive analytics(what to do)


visulization-------------------------------------------
showing data in graph or chart format

NLP----------------------------------------------------
how machine will understand your audio/speech, text 
alexa, siri 
it is complex because our language is natural it evolves with time so 
speech recognation 

Recommendation engine----------------------------------
based on association pricipals
collaboratue filtering 
lightfm open source lib for recommendation engline 
lib : NLTK 
	  textblobs
	  vader
	  gensim 

RPA----------------------------------------------------
removing maual activity and automate it using script or software 
selenium : automatic web scraping 
chatbots 
bots used by recruitment : allorics 

DS-----------------------------------------------------
anything related to data is data science 
it is an big umbrella 
it covers everything like analytics , data engineering , wrangling , etc 

data scientist : along with technical skill + good understanding for domain
