feature scaling = normalization 

while performing linear regression , model think that higher magnitude values are 
more important, but it is not perfectly correct. 

so we need strategy to common scale the data it is called normalization .

it requires when data is in different scale.

2 different strategy
1)standard scaling 
2)minmax scaling(deep learning)

it doesnt mean minmax only use in deep learning, standard scaling also used in deep 
learning as well . 

standard scaling--------------------------------------------------------

(x-mean) / SD,  SD=sqrt(variance)

if x> mean , ans will be +ve 
if x< mean , ans will be -ve 
all the values will be converted to -1 to 1 


minmax scaling----------------------------------------------------------

(x-min)/(max-min)
all the values will be converted to 0-1 scale 


after normalization all the data will become in ND 
so their avg is 0 , SD will become 1 .
