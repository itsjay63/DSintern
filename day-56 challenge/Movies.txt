There are two categories: 
Pos (reviews that express a positive or favorable 
sentiment)and 
Neg (reviews that express a negative or 
unfavorable sentiment).

For this code challenge, we will assume that 
all reviews are either positive or negative;
there are no neutral reviews.

Perform sentiment analysis on the text reviews 
to determine whether its positive
or negative and build confusion matrix to determine 
the accuracy.
