Code Challenge

  Dataset:
    Foodtruck.csv
  Problem Statement:
    Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering
    different cities for opening a new outlet.    
    
    The chain already has food-trucks in various cities and you have data for profits
    and populations from the cities.    
    
    You would like to use this data to help you select which city to expand to next.    
    
    Perform Simple Linear regression to predict the profit based on the
    population observed if you set up your outlet in Jaipur?
    
    (Current population in Jaipur is 3.073 million)  
    
    Hint:
    
    A negative value for profit indicates a loss.
