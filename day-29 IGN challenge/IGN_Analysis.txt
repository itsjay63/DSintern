  Problem Statement:
   Read the ign.csv file and perform the following task :
   
   Let's say we want to find games released for the Xbox One 
   that have a score of more than 7.
   
   review distribution for the Xbox One vs the review distribution 
   for the PlayStation 4. We can do this via a histogram, which will plot the 
   frequencies for different score ranges.
   
   
   
  Hint:

    The columns contain information about that game:

    score_phrase — how IGN described the game in one word. 
                   This is linked to the score it received.
    title — the name of the game.
    url — the URL where you can see the full review.
    platform — the platform the game was reviewed on (PC, PS4, etc).
    score — the score for the game, from 1.0 to 10.0.
    genre — the genre of the game.
    editors_choice — N if the game wasn't an editor's choice, Y if it was. This is tied to score.
    release_year — the year the game was released.
    release_month — the month the game was released.
    release_day — the day the game was released.
