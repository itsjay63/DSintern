AI : any machine which behave like human is a AI machine

how to enable machine as a AI machine ? 
ML : is a way to achive AI , but it is not the only way 

for data computation/processing we use neural network 
so this machine have a specific name is called deep learning 

Mathematics-------------------------------------------------------------- 
y=f(x) , x=independent variable 
		 y=dependent variable/target/response 
		 f=mapping function 
		 
in genereal case f and x is given so we can find y , in mathematics 

Ml-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	>But in ML world x and y are given so we can find f,so for the new values of x 
	 we can find y. 
	>finding mapping function is called training 
	 and finding values for y based on new x is called prediction 
	>this x and y called data set 
	>x = feature 
	>y = label 
	>we can choose right ML algorithms to find mapping function
	>ML algorithm called model
	>finding mapping function using ML model is called  training 

supervised ML -----------------------------------------------------------

dataset(x,y) is given so we can find mapping function
based on that prediction is there but what kind of prediction 
regrassion  or  classification
regrassion : number , continuous values 
			  salary prediction
			  box office collection prediction
			  percentage marks 
			  what will be the population 
			:algorithms 
				linear regrassion 
				random forest (RF)
				decision tree (DT)
				svr (support vector regressor)
classification : category /class 
                 victory/defeat 
				 hit / flop 
				 cat/dog 
				 green/ red signal 
				:algorithms
					KNN (k nearest neighbour)
					SVM (support vector machine)
					Naive baise 
					logistic regrassion
					DT
					RF
supervised dataset is called labled dataset 

unsupervised ML --------------------------------------------------------	

only feature data is given ,so it is called unlabled dataset		 

DL----------------------------------------------------------------------
>DL also classified in two things 
>supervised DL and Unsupervised DL 
>supervised DL : most of the business related problems are solved using this 
				:algorithms 
				>ANN(artificial nural network): basic backbone of any NN 
					it is so powerfull that it can perform regrassion and 
					classification both 
				>CNN(convoluted nural network): primarly use in CV 
				>RNN(recurrent nural network): 
						suggestion of words in gmail, it is a RNN based
						ML Model 


when to use ML and when to use DL ??
