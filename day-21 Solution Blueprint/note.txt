2 - data preparation 
3 - feature engineering 
4 - algorithm selection 
5 - train + tune
6 - UI

json is a data format it looks similar to dict in python
read_json : convert a json string to pandas object.

we use chunking method to handel large datasets(in gb) because of primary memory limit 
read_json('filename',chunking=1000000) 
so will get 33 chunks in total because 32292099 records / 1000000 = 33.

here, we merged all the sample csv(33) to balanced.csv
