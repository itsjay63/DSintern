after web scraping we have to save the data to some where so we cant lost it 
but if it in csv file (flat flie system). 
the thing is that in future if you want to make any update or change it is quite 
difficult to handle.
because in flat flie system there is no feature , that can enable me to update this
file , search data , delete data by code . 
to overcome this things we can use DB, because db provide this type of features.

mobile phone uses sqlite3 
address book uses sqlite3


collection = all the tables 
document = set of info(record)

if db is not exist , if you connect with name.db , it will create new db 

sql : SELECT * FROM table name WHERE condition 

cursor mechanism will create copy of db and put it inside the primary memory
