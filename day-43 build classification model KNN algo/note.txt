KNN - k nearest neighbour 

k is a value : 3,5,7,etc. 
why odd ??
if the value is 2 , it can creates 50-50 so we choose odd numbers 

so what would be right value for k 
if the value for k is low ... we can get result faster but quality of decision 
may be poor 

if the value for k is high .... it reqires high computation but it will also 
provide quality decision 

so value for k must be in balance
